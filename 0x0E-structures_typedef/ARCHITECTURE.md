# 🏗️ System Architecture

## 📖 Overview
This container introduces C structures and typedef concepts, demonstrating how to create custom data types, organize related data, and implement object-oriented programming concepts in C through structured data management.

## 🧩 Core Components

### Structure Definition System
- **Purpose**: Define custom data types with multiple members
- **Technology**: C struct keyword and member definitions
- **Location**: Structure definition exercises
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data member organization
  - Structure layout management
  - Member type specification
  - Structure size calculation
- **Interfaces**: Structure declaration syntax

### Member Access Manager
- **Purpose**: Provide access to structure members
- **Technology**: Dot notation and pointer member access
- **Location**: Structure manipulation functions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Direct member access
  - Pointer-based member access
  - Member value assignment
  - Structure copying operations
- **Interfaces**: Member access operators

### Type Definition Engine
- **Purpose**: Create aliases for complex types using typedef
- **Technology**: typedef keyword and type aliasing
- **Location**: Type definition declarations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Type name simplification
  - Custom type creation
  - Type abstraction management
  - Code readability enhancement
- **Interfaces**: Type definition syntax
