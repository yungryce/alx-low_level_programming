## What are Structures?

Structures, also known as structs, are user-defined data types in C that allow you to group different data types together under a single name. This enables you to create more complex data structures to organize and manipulate related data efficiently.

### Basic Structure Declaration

```c
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float gpa;
};
```

## Understanding typedef

The `typedef` keyword is used to create an alias for an existing data type. This can make code more readable and maintainable, especially when dealing with complex types like structures.

### Basic typedef Usage

```c
typedef unsigned long int size_t;
typedef struct Student Student_t;
```

### Combining struct and typedef

```c
typedef struct dog {
    char *name;
    float age;
    char *owner;
} dog_t;
```

## Project Files

- **[dog.h](./dog.h)**: Header file containing the definition of the `struct dog` and related function prototypes
- **[1-init_dog.c](./1-init_dog.c)**: Function to initialize a `struct dog` variable
- **[2-print_dog.c](./2-print_dog.c)**: Function to print the contents of a `struct dog` variable
- **[4-new_dog.c](./4-new_dog.c)**: Function to create a new dog (with proper memory allocation)
- **[5-free_dog.c](./5-free_dog.c)**: Function to free memory allocated for a dog

## Structure Usage Examples

### Declaration and Initialization

Structures can be declared and initialized in several ways:

```c
/* Declaration with separate initialization */
struct Student s1;
s1.name = "John Doe";
s1.age = 20;
s1.gpa = 3.8;

/* Declaration with initialization at definition */
struct Student s2 = {"Jane Smith", 21, 3.9};

/* Using designated initializers (C99 and later) */
struct Student s3 = {
    .name = "Bob Johnson",
    .age = 19,
    .gpa = 3.5
};
```

### Accessing Structure Members

You can access structure members using the dot `.` operator for structure variables or the arrow `->` operator for structure pointers:

```c
/* Using the dot operator */
printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name);
printf("Age: %d\n", s1.age);
printf("GPA: %.2f\n", s1.gpa);

/* Using the arrow operator with pointers */
struct Student *ptr = &s1;
printf("Name: %s\n", ptr->name);
printf("Age: %d\n", ptr->age);
printf("GPA: %.2f\n", ptr->gpa);
```

## Nested Structures

Structures can be nested inside other structures to create more complex data structures:

```c
struct Date {
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
};

struct Event {
    char title[100];
    struct Date eventDate;
    char location[100];
};

/* Accessing nested structure members */
struct Event conference;
conference.title = "Tech Conference";
conference.eventDate.day = 15;
conference.eventDate.month = 6;
conference.eventDate.year = 2023;
conference.location = "Convention Center";
```

## Arrays of Structures

You can create arrays of structures to store multiple records of the same type:

```c
struct Student students[3] = {
    {"Alice", 19, 3.5},
    {"Bob", 21, 3.2},
    {"Eve", 20, 3.9}
};

/* Accessing array elements */
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    printf("Student %d: %s, Age: %d, GPA: %.2f\n", 
           i+1, students[i].name, students[i].age, students[i].gpa);
}
```

## Structures with Dynamic Memory Allocation

When structures contain pointers, proper memory management is crucial:

```c
typedef struct person {
    char *name;
    int age;
} person_t;

/* Allocating memory for structure */
person_t *createPerson(const char *name, int age) {
    person_t *newPerson = malloc(sizeof(person_t));
    if (newPerson == NULL)
        return (NULL);
        
    /* Allocate memory for the name */
    newPerson->name = malloc(strlen(name) + 1);
    if (newPerson->name == NULL) {
        free(newPerson);
        return (NULL);
    }
    
    /* Copy the name */
    strcpy(newPerson->name, name);
    newPerson->age = age;
    
    return (newPerson);
}

/* Freeing memory */
void freePerson(person_t *person) {
    if (person == NULL)
        return;
        
    free(person->name);
    free(person);
}
```

## Passing Structures to Functions

### Passing by Value

When a structure is passed by value, a copy of the entire structure is created, which can be inefficient for large structures:

```c
void printStudent(struct Student student) {
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, GPA: %.2f\n", 
           student.name, student.age, student.gpa);
}

/* Usage */
printStudent(s1);
```

### Passing by Reference

Passing by reference (using pointers) is more efficient, especially for large structures:

```c
void printStudentRef(const struct Student *student) {
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, GPA: %.2f\n", 
           student->name, student->age, student->gpa);
}

/* Usage */
printStudentRef(&s1);
```

## Structure Padding and Memory Alignment

The compiler may add padding between structure members to ensure proper memory alignment:

```c
struct Example {
    char c;     /* 1 byte */
    /* 3 bytes padding (on many systems) */
    int i;      /* 4 bytes */
    char d;     /* 1 byte */
    /* 3 bytes padding (on many systems) */
};
```

On many systems, this structure would occupy 12 bytes rather than 6 bytes due to padding. You can use the `sizeof` operator to determine the actual size:

```c
printf("Size of struct Example: %lu bytes\n", sizeof(struct Example));
```

## Using typedef for Complex Types

The `typedef` keyword can significantly improve code readability, especially with complex types:

```c
/* Without typedef */
struct ComplexNumber {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
};

/* Using typedef */
typedef struct ComplexNumber Complex;

/* Even more concise */
typedef struct {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
} Complex;

/* Usage */
Complex z1 = {1.0, 2.0};
```

### Function Pointers with typedef

typedef makes function pointer declarations more readable:

```c
/* Without typedef */
int (*operation)(int, int);

/* With typedef */
typedef int (*Operation)(int, int);
Operation add, subtract, multiply;
```

## Common Applications of Structures

Structures are commonly used for various purposes, such as:

1. **Data Records**: Representing entities such as students, employees, or products
2. **Complex Data Types**: Creating custom types like complex numbers, vectors, or matrices
3. **API Interfaces**: Defining data formats for interacting with libraries and systems
4. **File Formats**: Mapping binary file structures for I/O operations
5. **Game Development**: Creating entities like players, enemies, or items

## Best Practices

1. **Use typedef for Clarity**: Create meaningful type names with typedef
2. **Proper Memory Management**: Be careful when allocating and freeing memory for structures with pointers
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for structures and typedefs
4. **Clear Documentation**: Document the purpose and use of each structure field
5. **Modular Design**: Design structures to encapsulate related data and operations

## Compilation

All files should be compiled using:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o output_file
```
