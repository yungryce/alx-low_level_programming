# Project Manifest: File I/O in C

## Project Identity
- **Name**: File I/O
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: File Operations and System Calls
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: C Language (C99)
- **Compiler**: GCC
- **System Calls**: open, close, read, write
- **Style Guide**: Betty

## Demonstrated Competencies
- File descriptor management
- File opening with permission flags
- Reading from files with buffers
- Writing to files with error handling
- File closing with validation
- System call implementation
- Binary file examination
- ELF header parsing
- Error handling for I/O operations
- Permission setting for new files

## System Context
This module explores file input/output operations in C using system calls. File I/O is fundamental for persistent data storage, configuration management, logging, and interprocess communication. Understanding how to properly handle files at the system call level provides insights into operating system interactions and resource management.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- GCC Compiler
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Understanding of file descriptors and permissions
- Knowledge of system calls

## Development Workflow
1. Analyze file operation requirements
2. Implement file handling using appropriate system calls
3. Apply proper error checking for all I/O operations
4. Manage file descriptors correctly
5. Test with various file types and conditions
6. Handle edge cases and error scenarios
7. Ensure resources are properly released
8. Verify file permissions and content

## Implementation Specifics

### Basic File Operations
- **Read File**: [0-read_textfile.c](./0-read_textfile.c) - Reads a text file and prints it to POSIX standard output
- **Create File**: [1-create_file.c](./1-create_file.c) - Creates a file with specific content
- **Append to File**: [2-append_text_to_file.c](./2-append_text_to_file.c) - Appends text to the end of a file

### File Copy Program
- **File Copier**: [3-cp.c](./3-cp.c) - Copies the content of one file to another with proper error handling

### ELF Header Analysis
- **ELF Header Parser**: [100-elf_header.c](./100-elf_header.c) - Displays information from the ELF header of an ELF file

### Header File
- **Function Prototypes**: [main.h](./main.h) - Contains all function prototypes for the project

## Learning Outcomes
- Using system calls for file operations
- Managing file descriptors appropriately
- Implementing proper error handling for I/O operations
- Creating and manipulating files with specific permissions
- Copying file content efficiently with buffers
- Understanding binary file structures (ELF format)
- Applying file operation best practices
- Handling different file types and edge cases
- Understanding the importance of resource cleanup
