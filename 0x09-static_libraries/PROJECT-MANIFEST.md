# Project Manifest: Static Libraries in C

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Static Libraries
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: Library Creation and Usage
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: C Language (C99)
- **Compiler**: GCC
- **Build Tools**: ar, ranlib
- **Style Guide**: Betty

## Demonstrated Competencies
- Static library creation and management
- Object file generation and archiving
- Library indexing and organization
- Multiple function compilation
- Build script development
- Makefile implementation
- Header file organization
- Function prototyping
- Code modularity and reusability
- Library linking in compilation

## System Context
This module introduces static libraries in C, which are collections of object files that are linked into a program during the linking phase of compilation. Static libraries promote code reuse, modular design, and separation of implementation from interface, which are essential practices in software development.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- GCC Compiler
- ar (archiver) utility
- ranlib for library indexing
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)
- Shell scripting knowledge

## Development Workflow
1. Create or gather related C functions
2. Compile individual C files into object files
3. Bundle object files into a static library archive
4. Create an index for the archive
5. Develop a comprehensive header file
6. Test library functionality
7. Create automation scripts for library generation
8. Document library contents and usage

## Implementation Specifics

### Library Components
- **Static Library**: [libmy.a](./libmy.a) - Contains compiled object files for various functions
- **Header File**: [main.h](./main.h) - Declares all function prototypes for the library

### Utility Scripts
- **Library Creation**: [create_static_lib.sh](./create_static_lib.sh) - Script to create a static library from C files

### Library Functions
The static library includes implementations of various functions covered in previous modules:
- Character functions (_putchar, _islower, _isalpha, etc.)
- String operations (strlen, strcpy, strcat, etc.)
- Memory functions (memset, memcpy, etc.)
- Mathematical operations (abs, factorial, etc.)

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the purpose and structure of static libraries
- Creating and managing static libraries using ar and ranlib
- Organizing code into reusable components
- Implementing proper header files for libraries
- Automating library creation with shell scripts
- Applying library linking in the compilation process
- Designing maintainable and modular code
- Separating interface from implementation
