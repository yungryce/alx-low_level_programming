## Command-Line Arguments: `argc` and `argv`

This repository contains a demonstration of using command-line arguments in a C/C++ program with the help of `argc` and `argv` parameters.

### Overview

When writing a command-line program, you often need to provide inputs or options to control its behavior. Command-line arguments allow users to pass such inputs to a program when launching it from a terminal or command prompt.

In C/C++, the main function can accept two parameters: `argc` and `argv`. Here's a brief explanation of each:

- `argc` (argument count): It represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself.
- `argv` (argument vector): It is an array of strings that holds the actual command-line arguments. The first element (`argv[0]`) is the name of the program, and the subsequent elements (`argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, and so on) represent the additional arguments passed.

### Usage

To use command-line arguments in your program, you can follow these steps:

1. Declare the `main` function with the `argc` and `argv` parameters:

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```

## Command-Line Arguments: `argc` and `argv`

This repository contains a demonstration of using command-line arguments in a C/C++ program with the help of `argc` and `argv` parameters.

### Overview

When writing a command-line program, you often need to provide inputs or options to control its behavior. Command-line arguments allow users to pass such inputs to a program when launching it from a terminal or command prompt.

In C/C++, the main function can accept two parameters: `argc` and `argv`. Here's a brief explanation of each:

- `argc` (argument count): It represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself.
- `argv` (argument vector): It is an array of strings that holds the actual command-line arguments. The first element (`argv[0]`) is the name of the program, and the subsequent elements (`argv[1]`, `argv[2]`, and so on) represent the additional arguments passed.

### Usage

To use command-line arguments in your program, you can follow these steps:

1. Declare the `main` function with the `argc` and `argv` parameters:

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}
```

2.  Access the command-line arguments inside the main function. You can use the argc and argv parameters to retrieve and process the arguments as needed.

```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Accessing the program name
    printf("Program name: %s\n", argv[0]);

    // Accessing additional arguments
    for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("Argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

3.  Compile and run the program from the command line, passing the desired arguments:
```shell
$ gcc program.c -o program
$ ./program arg1 arg2 arg3
```

##  Example

Inside this repository, you'll find an example program named command_line_args.c. It demonstrates how to access and process command-line arguments using argc and argv. To run the example program, follow these steps:

1.  Compile the program:

```shell
$ gcc command_line_args.c -o command_line_args
```

2.  Execute the program with some arguments:

```shell
$ ./command_line_args arg1 arg2 arg3
```

The program will display the program name and the provided arguments.

Feel free to explore and modify the example program to understand how command-line arguments work in C/C++.

##  Conclusion

Command-line arguments (argc and argv) provide a convenient way to pass inputs and options to a command-line program. Understanding how to use these parameters allows you to create flexible programs that can be customized based on user requirements.
