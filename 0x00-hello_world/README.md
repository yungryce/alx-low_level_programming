# Introduction to C Programming

This repository provides an introduction to the C programming language, covering script executables, preprocessors, and compilers.

## Script Executables

C programs are typically compiled into script executables that can be run on various operating systems. The C code is written in plain text files with a ".c" extension. These files are then compiled using a C compiler to generate an executable file that can be executed directly.

## Preprocessors

The C preprocessor is a tool that manipulates the source code before it is compiled. It performs various tasks, such as including header files, macro expansions, and conditional compilation. Preprocessor directives begin with a hash symbol (#) and are processed before the actual compilation of the code.

## Compilers

Compilers are software programs that translate human-readable C code into machine-readable instructions that can be executed by a computer. The compiler reads the C source files and produces object files containing machine code specific to the target architecture. These object files are then linked together to create the final executable.

Some popular C compilers include:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Clang
- Microsoft Visual C++
- Intel C++ Compiler

## Getting Started

To compile and run C programs, ensure that you have a compatible C compiler installed on your system. Choose a suitable compiler based on your operating system and preferences. Once installed, you can compile C programs using the command-line interface or integrated development environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code, Xcode, or Eclipse.

For more detailed instructions on setting up a development environment and compiling C programs, please refer to the documentation or tutorials specific to your chosen C compiler.

## Examples

In this repository, you will find examples of C code demonstrating various concepts in C. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with it to deepen your understanding of the C programming language.
