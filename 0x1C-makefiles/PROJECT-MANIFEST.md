- Function usage in makefiles
- Build process optimization

## System Context
This module introduces GNU Make and makefiles, essential tools for build automation in software development. Makefiles allow for efficient compilation of programs by tracking dependencies and rebuilding only what's necessary, saving time and ensuring consistency in the build process.

## Development Requirements
- Linux/Unix-based Operating System
- GNU Make (version 4.x+)
- GCC Compiler
- Text Editor (vi/vim/emacs)

## Development Workflow
1. Define the build goals and targets
2. Identify source files and their dependencies
3. Create rules for building targets
4. Define variables for flexibility and maintainability
5. Implement special targets for cleanup and maintenance
6. Test the build process with different scenarios
7. Optimize the makefile for efficiency

## Implementation Specifics

### Basic Makefile Structure
- **Simple Makefile**: [0-Makefile](./0-Makefile) - Basic makefile with a simple all rule
- **Variables**: [1-Makefile](./1-Makefile) - Introducing CC and SRC variables

### Intermediate Makefile Features
- **Multiple Rules**: [2-Makefile](./2-Makefile) - Adding OBJ and NAME variables, separating compilation and linking
- **Cleaning Rules**: [3-Makefile](./3-Makefile) - Implementing clean, oclean, fclean, and re rules

### Advanced Makefile Techniques
- **Complete Makefile**: [4-Makefile](./4-Makefile) - Adding CFLAGS for compiler flags
- **Python Function**: [5-island_perimeter.py](./5-island_perimeter.py) - Helper function implementation
- **Phony Targets**: [100-Makefile](./100-Makefile) - Advanced makefile with special handling and constraints

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding the purpose and structure of makefiles
- Creating efficient build systems for C programs
- Managing compilation dependencies
- Using variables and automatic variables in makefiles
- Implementing standard targets (all, clean, etc.)
- Applying pattern rules for flexible compilation
- Creating maintainable and portable makefiles
- Optimizing the build process for large projects
