# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

# Makefiles

This directory contains exercises and implementations that explore the functionality and usage of makefiles in C programming, focusing on build automation and dependency management.

## Learning Objectives

By completing the exercises in this directory, you will be able to:
- Understand what makefiles are and their purpose in the compilation process
- Utilize rules, variables, and patterns in makefiles
- Create efficient build systems for C projects
- Implement explicit and implicit rules
- Define and use variables in makefiles
- Apply proper dependency management techniques
- Understand the `make` utility's default rules

## What is a Makefile?

A makefile is a file (traditionally named `Makefile`) containing a set of directives used by the `make` build automation tool to generate executable programs and libraries from source code. Makefiles help streamline the compilation process, especially for large projects with multiple source files.

## Key Components of Makefiles

### Rules

Rules define targets, prerequisites, and recipes. They follow this general format:
```
target: prerequisites
    recipe
```

- **Target**: Usually the name of a file that is generated (e.g., object files, executables)
- **Prerequisites**: Files that are used as input to create the target
- **Recipe**: Actions taken by make to create the target (must be indented with a tab)

### Variables

Variables help make makefiles more readable and maintainable by storing values that can be reused throughout the makefile:

```
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
OBJS = main.o school.o

all: $(OBJS)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o school
```

Common variables include:
- `CC`: The C compiler to use
- `CFLAGS`: Compiler flags
- `SRC`: Source files
- `OBJ`: Object files
- `NAME`: Name of the executable

### Phony Targets

Phony targets are not associated with files but are used as labels for recipe groups:

```
.PHONY: all clean re

all: school

clean:
    rm -f *.o school

re: clean all
```

## Implemented Makefiles

This directory contains several makefile implementations with increasing complexity:

### [0-Makefile](./0-Makefile)
A basic makefile with a single rule that builds the `school` executable.

### [1-Makefile](./1-Makefile)
Introduces variables (`CC` and `SRC`) to make the makefile more flexible.

### [2-Makefile](./2-Makefile)
Adds object file handling with the `OBJ` and `NAME` variables, demonstrating proper dependency management.

### [3-Makefile](./3-Makefile)
Implements cleaning rules (`clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`) and a rule to force recompilation (`re`).

### [4-Makefile](./4-Makefile)
A complete makefile with compiler flags (`CFLAGS`) and comprehensive build rules.

### [100-Makefile](./100-Makefile)
An advanced makefile utilizing make's capabilities for more efficient and concise rules.

## The School Project

The makefiles in this directory compile a simple "school" project consisting of:

- [school.c](./school.c): Source file containing the `print_school` function
- [main.c](./main.c): Source file containing the `main` function
- [m.h](./m.h): Header file with function prototypes

## Make Commands

Common `make` commands used with these makefiles:

- `make`: Builds the default target (usually `all`)
- `make clean`: Removes object files
- `make fclean`: Removes object files and the executable
- `make re`: Forces recompilation by cleaning and then building

## Example Usage

```bash
# Build the school executable
make -f 4-Makefile

# Run the executable
./school

# Clean up object files
make -f 4-Makefile clean

# Remove both object files and executable
make -f 4-Makefile fclean

# Force recompilation
make -f 4-Makefile re
```

## Key Concepts

### Dependency Management
Makefiles track dependencies between files, rebuilding only what's necessary when source files change.

### Parallel Execution
The `make` utility can compile multiple source files simultaneously using the `-j` flag.

### Pattern Rules
Pattern rules use wildcards to create generic rules for file types:
```
%.o: %.c
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
```

### Special Variables
- `$@`: The target of the current rule
- `$<`: The first prerequisite of the current rule
- `$^`: All prerequisites of the current rule
