# Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This README provides an overview of pointers, arrays, and strings in the context of the C programming language.

## Pointers

- Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.
- They allow you to indirectly access and manipulate data in memory.
- Pointers can be used to allocate dynamic memory, pass arguments by reference, and create complex data structures.

## Arrays

- Arrays are a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
- They provide a convenient way to store and access multiple values of the same type.
- Arrays can be used to represent lists, matrices, and strings.

## Strings

- In C, strings are represented as arrays of characters, terminated by a null character '\0'.
- String manipulation functions are available in the C standard library, such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat`.
- C-style strings can be accessed and modified using array indexing and pointer arithmetic.
